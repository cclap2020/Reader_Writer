# Reader_Writer
## Reader Writer Project made with C++ <br />

Consider a situation where we have a file shared between many people. <br />

* If one of the people tries editing the file, no other person should be reading or writing at the same time, otherwise changes will not be visible to him/her. <br />
* However if some person is reading the file, then others may read it at the same time. <br />
